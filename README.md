# Detailed Planning

## Obtaining satellite data for complete plant geographic locations  
- Helpful in getting the complete layout of the plant, and there exact geographic locations.
- Will get to know about the hazard containing steps that is already being taken by the plant (which may be in a partial state).
- Get to know about what is in the surroundings (may be 5 km to 10 km radius)
    - a village
    - a plant (a shorter scale)
    ... etc.
- if the exact details for a particular section of the plant is not available then accessing the layout of the plant for it will be helpful *(potential challenge)*

## Accessing the stream data, P&ID diagrams for more detailed plant location analysis
- Locate and relate the staellite imaged equipments (major explosive or hazardous) with the P&ID diagrams
- Get the data for the compound stored, the device specs

## Finding the probability of hazardness, explosion, malfunctioning, etc...


## Finding the final impact of it on the various geographic locations in its vicinity

## Generative AI for Emergency Response Plans
